List of Programming Questions


=> 1. Implement a LRU cache //LRUCache.java

The task is to design and implement methods of an LRU cache. The class has two methods get and set which are defined as follows.
get(x)   : Gets the value of the key x if the key exists in the cache otherwise returns -1
set(x,y) : inserts the value if the key x is not already present. If the cache reaches its capacity it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting the new item.
In the constructor of the class the size of the cache should be initialized.
 
Input:
The first line of input contain an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test case follow. Each test case contains 3 lines. The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the capacity of the cache and then in the next line is an integer Q denoting the no of queries Then Q queries follow. A Query can be of two types
1. SET x y : sets the value of the key x with value y
2. GET x : gets the key of x if present else returns -1.

Output:
For each test case in a new line output will be space separated values of the query.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=10
1<=Q<=100

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input
2
2
2
SET 1 2 GET 1
2
7
SET 1 2 SET 2 3 SET 1 5 SET 4 5 SET 6 7 GET 4 GET 1

Output
2
5 -1

=> 2. Numbers with same first and last digit //NumbersWithSameFirstAndLastDigit.java

Given an range of number's starting with integer L and ending at R, the task is to count the numbers which have same first and last digits.

Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The T test case follow. The only line of the each test case contains two space seperated integer's L and R. 

Output:
For each test case output a single line containing a single integer denoting the count of the required number's.

Constraints:
1<=T<=104
1<=L, R<=10^8

Example:
Input:
2
7 68
5 40

Output:
9
8
